%Building NETCONF-enabled Network Management Systems w/ libnetconf
Krejci (2013)~\cite{libnetconf-krejci} presents the open source library \textit{libnetconf} in his work, which is used by \textit{Netopeer2}. In addition to the various use cases for developing network management applications based on the NETCONF protocol using the presented library, the supported NETCONF capabilities are outlined and guidelines for using the library are given. However, further open-source and commercial YANG-based network software solutions are not compared to the \textit{libnetconf} library in greater detail.

% confD, netopeer,...?

Bajpai and Schönwälder (2014) \cite{netconf-interop-lab} present a NETCONF interoperability lab platform to evaluate NETCONF server and client implementations based on various test-cases. In their work, four different tools are compared, including \textit{YumaPro}, \textit{OpenYuma}, \textit{ConfD} and \textit{libnetconf}.

To our knowledge, there is no other work that analyzes Clixon as a YANG-based network management framework in more detail.


%    Since the standardized and proven technologies such as NETCONF and YANG are increasingly being used in the industry and YANG-based configuration managers are therefore required on the respective devices, it is important to evaluate the tools available on the market.
