\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

The prototype has proven that \textit{Clixon} satisfies its claim to be easily adaptable to many platforms and architectures without any substantial changes.
The modular and generic structure of the framework not only allows the mentioned flexibility in terms of operating system or system architecture, but also makes necessary changes much easier, which is an important aspect for development and deployment.

The plugin architecture also proved to be very capable and application-oriented during the development of the prototype due to the existing functionalities of the framework and the accompanying flexibility of the plugins. 

However, the comparison with the two alternatives \textit{Netopeer} and \textit{ConfD} also showed that \textit{Clixon} still has potential for improvement in some areas, such as the partially deviating implementation from the standards.

With regard to the \textit{ietf-tcp} model, there are still a few open topics that can be implemented with upcoming kernel support for the missing authentication features and future releases of the \textit{Clixon} framework.
