YANG-based network management is gaining importance and requires corresponding implementations. This paper evaluates and compares the open source framework \textit{Clixon} with other well-known open source solutions as well as commercial alternatives. We analyze the the \textit{Clixon} framework with a prototype. As use case it implements the draft of a standard YANG model for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Our results confirm that \textit{Clixon} is a a portable and extensible implementation well-suited for YANG-based management.
