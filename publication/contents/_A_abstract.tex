\begin{abstract}

YANG-based network management is becoming increasingly important, and so is the need for appropriate tools. We therefore evaluated and compared the open source framework \textit{Clixon} with already well-known open source solutions as well as commercial alternatives. In particular, the portability and extensibility of the open-source framework \textit{Clixon} was analyzed using a prototype for the draft YANG model \textit{ietf-tcp}.
